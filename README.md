# Composer template for Drupal projects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drupal-composer/drupal-project.svg?branch=8.x)](https://travis-ci.org/drupal-composer/drupal-project)

This project template should provide a kickstart for managing your site
dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

If you want to know how to use it as replacement for
[Drush Make](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/master/docs/make.md) visit
the [Documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/2471553).

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project taoti/drupal-project:8.x-dev some-dir --stability dev --no-interaction
```

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your installation.

```
cd some-dir
composer require drupal/devel:8.*
```

## What does the template do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal will be installed in the `web`-directory.
* Autoloader is implemented to use the generated composer autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`,
  instead of the one provided by Drupal (`web/vendor/autoload.php`).
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`) will be placed in `web/modules/contrib/`
* Theme (packages of type `drupal-theme`) will be placed in `web/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) will be placed in `web/profiles/contrib/`
* Creates default writable versions of `settings.php` and `services.yml`.
* Creates `sites/default/files`-directory.
* Latest version of drush is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drush`.
* Latest version of DrupalConsole is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drupal`.

## Updating Drupal Core

Updating Drupal core is a two-step process.

1. Update the version number of `drupal/core` in `composer.json`.
1. Run `composer update drupal/core`.
1. Run `./scripts/drupal/update-scaffold [drush-version-spec]` to update files
   in the `web` directory, where `drush-version-spec` is an optional identifier
   acceptable to Drush, e.g. `drupal-8.0.x` or `drupal-8.1.x`, corresponding to
   the version you specified in `composer.json`. (Defaults to `drupal-8`, the
   latest stable release.) Review the files for any changes and restore any
   customizations to `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`.
1. Commit everything all together in a single commit, so `web` will remain in
   sync with the `core` when checking out branches or running `git bisect`.

## Generate composer.json from existing project

With using [the "Composer Generate" drush extension](https://www.drupal.org/project/composer_generate)
you can now generate a basic `composer.json` file from an existing project. Note
that the generated `composer.json` might differ from this project's file.


## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download

Composer recommends **no**. They provide [argumentation against but also workrounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull request is often a better solution), you can do so with the [composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL to patch"
        }
    }
}
```

### What are the deployment steps?

Deployments have a few extra steps to get the correct library and dependency updates.
You can automate this by using [Githooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)
or your favorite deployment tool. An example of what the basic deployment steps are can be found 
in `scripts/deploy/deploy.sh`. The basic steps are as follows, the paths may change depending on environment:

*  `cd /path/to/webroot/`
*  Use `ls` to check for the preseence of the `./.vendor` directory. That means you are are the correct folder.
*  `composer install` Here is where you install/update your libraries.
*  `cd ./web/` now we go to the webroot run our rush commands. Drush may be installed on the device, but the safe
version of drush to use will be the one packaged in with .vendor so we run drush like this:
*  ```
   ../vendor/bin/drush updb -y # run update.php
   ../vendor/bin/drush cr all # cache rebuild
   ../vendor/bin/drush cim git -y # configuration import
   ../vendor/bin/drush cr all # last cache rebuild
   ```
